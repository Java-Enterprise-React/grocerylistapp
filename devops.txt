----CONCEPTUAL
What is devops?
    devops is a mindset in a company. Development and Operations must cooperate to automate the deployment of our applications

What are CI/CD pipelines?
    - series of steps with the ability to automate a step of the deployment

Continuous Integration:
    - when a new commit happens, a CI pipeline will automate the building and testing of the project

Continuous Delivery:
    - automation of build, testing and deploying to a production like environment.
    - then if all the manual tests happen in the production-like environment, it will then be manually deployed to production

Continious Deployment:
    - automation of build, testing, production-like env and then deploying to production


----PRACTICAL
How are we going to be making a CI/CD pipeline?
    - AWS Elastic Beanstalk: it is one abstraction away from an EC2
            - Elastic beanstalk will run your application on an ec2 based on the configuration you provide
    - AWS CodeBuild: define a series of steps to build our application
    - AWS CodePipeline: service that allows us to create the CI/CD pipelines
        - We will be defining a CodeBuild as well what Elastic Beanstalk Environment
